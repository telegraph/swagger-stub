    "fullDescription": "<p>Cala Rajada is a well-established resort and port on the beautiful north east coast of Majorca that up until a few years ago was virtually undiscovered by British tourists. Â It has a wonderful sea front promenade where you can stroll or sit outside one of the many tapas bars and enjoy a glass of local wine or just people watch. The atmosphere here is very Spanish. The nearby bay at Cala Agulla is one of the prettiest beaches in Majorca because it lies in a protected zone and the backdrop is simply a large pine forest. Â Keen walkers can head off to the sand dunes at Cala Mesquida or climb up through the forest to reach the impressive views over eastern Majorca from the ruined tower at Son Jaumell. Â This region is also very popular with golfers as there are no less than 4 championship standard golf courses within 5 - 15 minutes from our hotel. You are welcome to enjoy delightful coastal and countryside walks, play a game of table tennis or mini golf on the hotel terraces, unwind in the onsite sauna or spa, or simply just enjoy friendly bridge sessions and interesting seminars.</p><p></p><p>Â </p>"
