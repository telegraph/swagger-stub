On arrival at the local airstrip, you take a 10 min boat ride across the river to Tortuga Lodge. This popular and delightful eco-friendly property has large screened open-frame windows allowing the nocturnal symphony of the forest such as the roar of howler monkeys into your room. Each also has a wide veranda with a hammock overlooking the river. There is an attractive pool area and adjacent hammock rancho. This is true wilderness: it isn't the Caribbean of resort hotels, sugary beaches and piña coladas.<br /></p>"

      "heading": "Day 3 - Wildlife spotting excursion and village visit in Tortuguero",
      "description": "<p>Set off on a wildlife adventure on a guided boat trip through the mangrove forest of Tortuguero National Park, now one of the last protected areas of tropical rainforest in Central America, with 11 different natural habitats and a huge range of endemic wildlife, much of which can be spotted as you glide through the water. There are 3 species of monkeys (Spider, Howler, and White-faced), Three-toed sloths, and River otters are often seen along the natural inland waterways and canals. Caimans, iguanas, river turtles, lizards and poison-dart frogs inhabit the area, along with over 320 species of birds including three of toucan and eight of parrot. <br /></p><p>The park was originally intended to conserve a major nesting beach of the Atlantic green sea turtle and although less frequent these days, you can sea leatherbacks too. Visit the nearby turtle museum to gather some information about the nesting cycle of these ancient reptiles. In season, take a night-time walk along the moonlit beach, and search for turtles and their eggs. </p><p>In season you will have the opportunity to request a private guided turtle observation expedition: if you travel between June and October you might be lucky enough to see them laying their eggs (Please ask one of our experts for details). You'll also have a guided tour of Tortuguero village including a visit to the Caribbean Conservation Corporation Museum. Flanked by rivers and waterways on one side and Caribbean beach on the other, this faraway village serves as a sleepy hub for visitors to the area, human and otherwise.</p>"

      "description": "<p>Fly back to San José in a Cessna (or equivalent) light aircraft: a 25 min airborne adventure where you skim over the countryside with volcano views. Land at a small airstrip and continue by road to Arenal (three-four hours). It's modest 1,674m Arenal is an impressive conical volcano dominating the surroundings, although it last erupted in 1998. These days, even lava flow and volcanic eruptions are infrequent and there has not been any significant activity since 2010. However, as seismic activity is often unpredictable, the situation may change by the time you travel. Even without any recent volcanic activity, the region is still considered to be one of the highlights of a visit to Costa Rica. Your lodge is on the road between La Fortuna de San Carlos and Arenal Lake, and is surrounded by dense tropical rainforest. There are two pools, a spa and a Jacuzzi. The al fresco restaurant is nicely situated beside the pool. There are many adventurous excursions offered from the lodge including hikes to waterfalls, kayaking, river rafting and horse riding.</p>"

It has become renowned for opportunities to observe water-associated birds, especially during migrations. You'll be picked up by your bilingual guide and taken to the small town of Los Chiles to begin your nature cruise. <br /></p><p>It's an enchanting three hour boat trip up the Río Frío through the reserve to Caño Negro lake, a shallow overflow from the river in the wet season (it's dry in March-April). In the months of July -November, the reserve acts as a wintering site for migrant American birds. During the dry season the water level steadily falls, until all that is left is the Río Frío's main channel. Most birds make their appearance at this time. These include the Glossy ibis, Black-necked stilt, American widgeon, Northern shoveller, and Snail kite. Along the shores of the river and in the trees that bend over its waters, you'll be able to spot birds, mammals, reptiles and amphibians. There are Howler, Spider and White-faced monkeys, Three-toed sloths, caimans, turtles, bats and tropical flora.</p>"

These waters provide a more off-the-beaten-track experience than their better-known and more overcrowded cousins. Set well back from the road that runs between the lake and the town of La Fortuna, the farm has only recently been opened to the general public. The springs, five free-flowing pools, set in a natural river gorge vary in temperature from 38ºC to 43ºC depending on the pool.</p>"

      "description": "<p>It's a three hour drive to Bajos del Toro in the cloud-forest below Poás volcano, to stay at Bosque de Paz Lodge close to Bosque de Paz Rainforest Reserve. It's a privately-owned reserve with a spectacularly rich ecosystem because of its privileged location on the continental divide, with altitudes ranging from 1,450 to 2,450m.  It isn't as well-known or visited as other reserves at this altitude, but is just as stunning, with waterfalls and trout pools, and is the habitat of a wide range of bird and orchid species. It's only a 90 min drive from San José, but feels very remote. The small and friendly lodge embraces easy forest hiking trails and an orchid garden. You can see many hummingbirds flitting between the feeders scattered around the property.</p>"

      "description": "<p>The reserve is open only to prearranged visits. The number of visitors is limited so that environmental impact is kept at minimum levels, and visitors receive personal attention. The three main objectives here are: conservation, research and education. Most of the earnings are reinvested to purchase more forest to add to the privately protected area. You will have a guided tour of the trails in parts of the reserve from a local guide who can only be booked on site. During your visit, you will have the opportunity to pay a symbolic fee to plant a tree to help with the regeneration of the forest in areas that were once cleared.<br /></p>"

Wildlife reserves have been established throughout this lush region, notably Corcovado National Park, with magnificent biodiversity, sheltering rare species of mammals including the Central American Squirrel monkey, White-faced capuchin, ocelots and tapirs. Caimans and crocodiles lurk watchful in the dark lagoons. <br /></p><p>The reserve is absolutely brimming with wildlife, and the diversity of flora is equally mind-boggling. You are bound to see loads of birds, animals and exotic flowering plants. You will be met at the airport and driven along a paved road to Sierpe, (30 mins). Here, embark on a 90 min motor-launch ride through forest canals and mangroves. </p><p>The area has 13 separate ecosystems with almost 100 kinds of tree, over 350 species of bird, and a healthy population of Scarlet macaws, tapirs and jaguars. The Casa Corcovado Lodge, located near the entrance to Corcovado National Park, is a steep 10 min climb from the beach where you've just disembarked; your luggage will be transported from the launch by tractor.</p>"
