  "overview": "<p>Experience the best of Scotland and Ireland on this exhilarating cruise. The ship will drop anchor at the lively Irish cities of Belfast, Dublin and Cork, and sail between the ancient, mysterious Scottish isles of Lewis and Mull. En route, you can venture along the wild Antrim coast and skip across the strange-shaped rocks that form the Giants Causeway. The man-made arrangement of standing stones at Callanish in the Outer Hebrides are no less magnetic and are believed to be 4,000 years old. <br />There is more Scottish history to explore at Mulls Duart Castle, the seat of the Clan MacLean, a short trip from the harbour at Tobermory with its distinctive multi-coloured houses. On a shore excursion from Cork, you could go for fish and chips in the charming village of Kinsale or kiss the famous Blarney Stone at the castle north of the city. The Irish capital, Dublin, offers a buzzing mix of traditional pubs, modern restaurants and trendy shops on both sides of the River Liffey.</p>",
